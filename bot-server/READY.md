# ✅ Bot Server is Ready!

## All Fixed! 🎉

All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved:
- ✅ Properties initialized with definite assignment assertions (`!`)
- ✅ Error handling uses proper type guards (`error instanceof Error`)
- ✅ Object spread conflicts resolved
- ✅ All dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ Code compiles without errors

## Start Now! 🚀

### Quick Start
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Or use Windows batch file
```bash
dev.bat
```

## What to Expect

When you start the server, you'll see:

```
🚀 Initializing Bomberman Bot Server...
📝 Program ID: 3XcKrwCkn5e9Gxk7reHZK7SGn4P64hqax4AdTE82fWTU
🎯 Matches PDA: ...
💰 Vault PDA: ...
✅ Blockchain initialized
🌐 Server running on http://localhost:3000
📊 Health check: http://localhost:3000/health
🎮 Games list: http://localhost:3000/games
🤖 Bot server is now monitoring for matches!
📡 Scanning for games every 30 seconds...
```

## Before Starting

Make sure you have:
1. ✅ Solana wallet configured (`~/.config/solana/id.json`)
2. ✅ RPC endpoint set in `.env` (defaults to devnet)
3. ✅ (Optional) A test game created with `npm run create-game`

## Important Notes

### First Run
The server will initialize blockchain connections. This may take a few seconds.

### Waiting Period
Bots automatically join games that have been **open for more than 3 minutes**.

To skip the wait for testing:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scan
```

### Monitor Activity
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# List games
curl http://localhost:3000/games

# View specific game
curl http://localhost:3000/game/YOUR_GAME_PDA
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start the server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Create a test game**: `npm run create-game` (in another terminal)
3. **Watch it work**: Bots will auto-join after 3 minutes
4. **Or trigger manually**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scan`
