## 🏃 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1️⃣ Install
```bash
cd bot-server
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Create Test Game
```bash
npm run create-game
```

### 3️⃣ Start Bot Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

**That's it!** The server will now automatically:
- 🔍 Scan for games every 30 seconds
- 🤖 Join with bots after 3 minutes
- 🎮 Play intelligently using AI
- 💣 Place bombs and compete

## 🎯 What It Does

The bot server automatically:

1. **Monitors** on-chain matches
2. **Detects** games needing bots (>3 min, <4 players)
3. **Joins** with intelligent bots
4. **Plays** using AI (A* pathfinding, strategic bombs)
5. **Competes** until game ends

## 🧪 Test Commands

```bash
# Create a test game
npm run create-game

# Test bot joining
npm run test-bot

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🌐 API Endpoints

While running, test these:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# List games
curl http://localhost:3000/games

# Trigger scan
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scan

# Get game state
curl http://localhost:3000/game/GAME_PDA_HERE

# Stop bots
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/stop-bots
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `.env` (copy from `env.example`):

```env
# Solana RPC
ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com

# Ephemeral Rollup (MagicBlock)
PROVIDER_ENDPOINT=https://devnet.magicblock.app/
WS_ENDPOINT=wss://devnet.magicblock.app/

# Server
PORT=3000
MAX_BOTS_PER_GAME=3
SCAN_INTERVAL_MS=30000
```

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### Change Bot Behavior
Edit `src/ai/botAI.ts`:
```typescript
private decisionCooldown: number = 500; // Reaction speed
```

### Change Scan Frequency
Edit `src/monitor/matchMonitor.ts`:
```typescript
private scanInterval: number = 30000; // 30 seconds
```

### Add More Bots
Edit `.env`:
```env
MAX_BOTS_PER_GAME=3  # Change to 4 for all slots
```

## 🎮 Bot AI Features

- ✅ **State Machine**: 5 priority-based states
  1. Escaping (from bombs)
  2. Attacking (enemy nearby)
  3. Collecting (breaking boxes)
  4. Hunting (chasing enemies)
  5. Exploring (random movement)

- ✅ **A* Pathfinding**: Optimal grid navigation
- ✅ **Bomb Awareness**: Avoids blast radius
- ✅ **Strategic Bombing**: Only with escape route
- ✅ **Survival Focus**: Prioritizes staying alive

## 📊 Monitoring

Watch console logs for:

```
🔍 Scanning for matches...           # Regular scans
🎯 Game needs bots! (2/4 players)   # Detection
🤖 Creating bot: 7sKd...             # Bot creation
🎮 Bot joining game at (1, 1)...     # Joining
✅ Bot joined game successfully      # Success
⏳ Waiting for game delegation...    # Delegation check
🎮 Starting game loop...             # Game start
🚶 Bot moved up (energy: 2)         # Actions
💣 Bot placed bomb                   # Bomb placement
🏁 Game ended for bot               # Completion
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Bot not joining?
- Check game is >3 minutes old
- Verify <4 players
- Ensure game status is "Waiting"
- Try: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/scan`

### No games found?
- Create one: `npm run create-game`
- Check matches PDA is initialized

### Bots not moving?
- Wait for delegation (check logs)
- Verify ephemeral endpoint is accessible

### Transaction errors?
- Check bot has SOL (auto-airdropped on devnet)
- Verify RPC endpoint is responsive

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Day 1**: Run quick start, watch it work
2. **Day 2**: Read TESTING.md, create games
3. **Day 3**: Read README.md, understand architecture
4. **Day 4**: Modify AI in `src/ai/botAI.ts`
5. **Day 5**: Deploy and customize for your needs

## 🚀 Ready to Go!

Everything is set up and ready to run. The bot server:

✅ Integrates perfectly with your Bomberman program
✅ Follows exact patterns from `test.ts`
✅ Uses proper PDAs and transaction structures
✅ Handles ephemeral rollups correctly
✅ Has intelligent AI for strategic gameplay
✅ Includes comprehensive documentation

**Next step**: Run `npm run dev` and watch the magic happen! 🎮
